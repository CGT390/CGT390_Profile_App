  bio: "My name is Gillian Hanley, and I am currently a junior here at Purdue. I am studying Web Programming and Design, and I am working towards a minor in Computer Science. I love creating websites, and love learning as much as I can about them. I am originally from St. Louis, MO, but my family lives in Gainsville, GA. I have three siblings, one older sister, and a younger brother and sister. We also have two teenage cats, Scooter and Habibi (Habibi is a little plump, and Scooter is the energetic one). I love playing frisbee at Purdue, crocheting, and getting a good sweet treat whenever I can."
